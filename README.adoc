# dhv-fragen: convert DHV questions to an Anki-friendly form

(DHV E-Learning Prüfungsfragen A-Schein zu Karteikarten
konvertieren.)

The theory test for the German ‘A-Schein’ paragliding licence
contains multiple-choice questions drawn from a published list.
Registered users of https://dhv.onlearning.at/ can download
the list in PDF form. This Python script converts PDFs downloaded
from onlearning into a tab-separated text file and accompanying
directory of images suitable for import into the
https://apps.ankiweb.net/[Anki] flashcard system.

Notes:

 - The script runs on Python >=3.5 and requires the following
   external utilities:
   `pdftotext`, `pdfimages`, `qpdf`, `gm` (GraphicsMagick)

 - This repository does not contain any of the questions
   themselves, because I assume that I don't have the right to
   redistribute them. You need to provide your own PDFs to do
   anything useful with this script.

 - The script was developed for Version 5 (22.02.2016) of the
   question set. There are a couple of quirks in the source
   PDFs that need special-case handling, so it will probably
   fail on other versions.

 - The script takes two input PDFs: "Lernstoff.pdf", the
   list of questions (the version _with_ the correct answers
   marked), and "Bilder.pdf", the accompanying illustrations.

 - The script produces a tab-separated text file that can be
   imported into Anki, and an accompanying directory of images.
   The images should be copied into Anki's media directory.

 - The output file has five columns: question, correct answer,
   and three wrong answers. It's designed for use with the
   https://github.com/edjane-stewart/anki-quiz-deck[anki-quiz-deck]
   template, which randomizes the order of answers every time
   a card is shown.
